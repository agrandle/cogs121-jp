- Obtained data of popular locations in San Diego, specifically beaches and attractions such as zoos and theme parks
- Placed markers on the map for the locations I researched
- Set up a Bootstrap grid system for the web page
- Created a sidebar that displays location information when a marker's clicked on the map (for a single marker currently)
- Added code that makes a marker display a popup message when the user hovers over it (for a single marker currently)

When a user clicks on a marker for a location, the sidebar on the left displays detailed information
of that location such as the name, description, address, price, and category. Currently, it works
for a single marker only. For milestone 5, the application had a map with a few markers on it.
As of now, we have a map populated with a bunch of markers of popular locations in San Diego.
