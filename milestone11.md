Paul Kim:
- Created list of locations in sidebar. Implemented a function that populates
the sidebar with data from a JSON file. Each location box shows the name,
price, category, and address currently.
- Added tabs to the sidebar, one for the places in San Diego and the other for
places that the user saves. When the user clicks on either tab, it shows the
corresponding places
- Implemented basic save/remove feature. When the user clicks the Save button
for a location in the list, it gets appended to the Saved Places section. When
the user clicks the Remove button for a saved location, it gets removed from
the Saved Places section.
- The screenshots below show the sidebar that I worked on.
