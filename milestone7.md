When a user clicks on a marker for a location, the sidebar on the left displays detailed information
of that location such as the name, description, address, price, and category. Currently, it works
for a single marker only. For milestone 5, the application had a map with a few markers on it.
As of now, we have a map populated with a bunch of markers of popular locations in San Diego.

When user clicks on "Map Feature", the page uses smooth scrolling to go down to the map page. More pages will be added for our next milestone. Clicking the title "Explore SD" will scroll back up to the starting page.
