Elevator Pitch

What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.

We are trying to develop an application that provides popular travel locations
to tourists and newcomers visiting San Diego. We help our users plan out
their itinerary during their stay by allowing them to view the locations on
a map and save them in a list.

How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

Currently, lots of travelers use either Google Maps or Yelp to find popular
travel locations around their area. The limitations of these practices are that
they have too much information that could often be overwhelming to users.

What’s new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?

We provide custom curated locations, which show important information
that travelers need without overwhelming them. We have a feature that allows
users to save interesting locations on a list, so they can see all of those
places easily. We provide simple filters based on categories and prices, which
helps them narrow down their options. It will be successful because it is
focused on just San Diego.

Who cares? If you’re successful, what difference will it make?

Tourists and newcomers to San Diego may find the application useful and easy to
use because it is simple and contains the most relevant information that they
need to explore San Diego. Although our application focuses on San Diego for now,
in the future it could be applied to other cities as well. It will help them
narrow down their options and save time.
