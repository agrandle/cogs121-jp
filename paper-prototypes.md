Paul Kim

Description: My prototype involves two main interactions with the map. The user can click on states and areas, and the map will zoom in automatically. Also, the user can hover over states and areas, and the application will show relevant information on the top right section. The user can click on landmarks/tourist spots on the map, and a description or other relevant information will pop up in the top right section.

Judd Gatbonton

Description: my prototype starts from the beginning page of the app where the user enters the budget and duration of his trip. Once the user clicks "Finish", the app brings you to a map of the US where the states are divided and if you hover over a state, it will show a little box with the average prices of hotels, foods and other info. The filter on the top left is used to filter what info you want to see in that box. The next window is after you click on a state and it zooms into the state which is divided into its different cities. When you click on a city, it zooms in again and now there are icons for hotels/food/landmarks. Hovering over an icon will show a little description but you can also click on it and it will then bring you to a new page with a more detailed description of the icon.

Ranvijay Singh

Description: My prototype asks users to select their location (city and state) first. Then it asks users their budet for housing and travel fare and asks them their date of departure and date of arrival. Then it inquires about the user's mode of travel (whether they want to book a mode of travel such as airways, by train etc or if they have it already figured out). Then it shows them the reults of available spaces to stay in based off of their inputs and tells them the cost/night of each place. It also gives them the option to use airbnb. Finally it shows them the popular landmarks/places that may be worth visiting during their stay

Anthony Grundle

Description: My prototype shows in detail what a zoomed in view of a city interaction would look like. Essentially users would have the opportunity to choose whether or not they want to check out food places, landmarks, or activities. Then the user can also filter out certain places at any point by clicking o the filter that can show what the user's budget is. Each region within the city (like P.B.) will be color coded to show how affordable each area generally is. Finally the user can click on a landmark or activity and it will show how good the landmark/activity/restaurant is based off of other users' reviews and comments that the user can scroll through.
