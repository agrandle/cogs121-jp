Paul Kim

Description: My interaction starts from the home screen of our application.
Users input their start location, and it scroll down smoothly to our map where
markers of popular places in San Diego are displayed. When the user clicks on
a marker on the map, it shows detailed information about that place in the
sidebar and also draws a route from your start location to that place. The user
could save places onto a list, so that they could see the places that interested
them at a single glance.
