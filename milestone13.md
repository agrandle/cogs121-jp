Paul Kim:
- Modified code to display the list of San Diego places without hiding it when
the application's loaded initially
- Added "View on Map" and "View Details" buttons for each place in the sidebar
- Implemented a function that centers the map around a place and displays a
popup message of its name when the "View on Map" button is clicked for that
place in the sidebar.
- Added a modal that displays information for each individual place
- Implemented a function that fills in the modal body of a place with its
information when the "View Details" button is clicked. The modal pops up when
the button is clicked.
- Made saved places section scrollable too
- Fixed a bug (cannot save the same place multiple times anymore)
- The screenshots below show what I worked on
