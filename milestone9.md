Team Member Work Done

Paul Kim:
- Implemented a function that draws a route between two locations on the map using
Leaflet Routing Machine
- Added code that closes popup messages of markers when the cursor's not hovered
over markers
- Added code that allows user to click on a marker and select it as either a start
location or destination. When the user clicks either, it fills an input form
with the corresponding address. After the start location and destination are
selected, it draws the route between the two markers.
- Added markers for my locations (beaches, attractions)

Judd Gatbonton:
- Added markers for my locations (museums and stadiums) into the json file
- Did research on plugins for geocoders for the leaflet map so user can input their starting address
- Helped in adding code to the geocode plugin and assisted in the routing feature of the app
- Redesigned first page and manipulated formatting with Bootstrap on our webpage

- A user can now click on a marker and select it as either a start location or
destination. After the user selects both a start location and destination, the
map shows a route between the two locations on the map. A container in the
top-right shows the start location and destination addresses and directions.
- A user can now filter searches on the map. User can filter by Attractions, Museums, Historical Buildings, Parks and Trails, and Landmarks
- We plan to implement more interactions on the map like allowing users to click on
a marker and save it onto a list. We might add a randomizer button on the map that
randomly chooses a location. We may add more features/interactions on the map
in the future.
